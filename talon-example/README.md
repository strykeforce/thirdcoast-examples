# talon-example

**This example project is no longer current.**

This project demonstrates our 2018 method of provisioning Talons using our Third Coast library. With the additions made to the CTRE Phoenix libraries during the summer of 2018, especially `TalonSRXConfiguration` and friends, we no longer need to maintain our separate library for this.

This project also utilizes our 2018 method of using the [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) framework to manage dependency injection (DI).  While DI is still useful and used by us, we find that manually managing DI provides a better learning experience for students during the season.
